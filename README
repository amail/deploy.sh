COMFIRM DEPLOY.SH - README
==========================
(C) 2012 Comfirm AB

Deploy your code, files, configurations etc. to multiple servers via ssh.
Perfect for the cloud. Written as a shell script (sh, standard bourne shell) and
runs on every unix server. No need for remote install. Just run the
deploy.sh script on the local machine.

USAGE
=====
 To deploy, run:
 ./deploy --install [ .deploy location ]
 
 To update already existing deployment, run:
 ./deploy --update [ .deploy location ]
 
 It will run copy, replace and update-s2...
 
 Partial deployment options:
 ./deploy --begin        Run begin script
 ./deploy --copy         Copy files to /tmp
 ./deploy --replace      Replace the old files
 ./deploy --finish       Run the finish script
 ./deploy --update-s2    Run the update script, only
 
 If the location where the .deploy file isn't specified, deploy.sh will assume
 it's in the current directory.

WHAT YOU NEED
=============
 * The same username to all servers.
 * An ssh keyfile without passphrase.
 * The ssh key should be the same for all servers.
 * [optional] Root access or sudo without password.
 * sh or bash.
 
 Note:
 	This script was designed for elastic cloud computing.

INSTALLATION
============
 * Copy deploy.conf to /etc/deploy.conf
 * Create a .deploy file in your project. You can use the sample deploy file
   shipped with this release. Just make sure to rename it.
 * Put the deploy.sh in a handy place like /usr/local/sbin/deploy.sh and make it
   executable. If you want you can even put it in your project location.
   
TIPS & TRIX
===========
 * To make it even easier you can let any heartbeat software update
   the deploy.conf automatically.
 * Write your .deploy file with if statements etc. to make it easy to rerun it
   everytime there's new servers or if the old ones need any updates.
